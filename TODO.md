# Task: Add Filter Icon and Filtering on Data Analytics Page

## Steps:

1. Add a filter icon button near the top of the faculty-dataanalytics.html page.
2. Create a filter panel (initially hidden) with controls for:
   - Time range selection (e.g., last 7 days, 30 days).
   - Toggle for showing Top Performers only.
   - Toggle/filter for Engagement details.
   - Toggle for Bottom Liners (bottom performers).
3. Update rendering functions in JavaScript to apply filters based on selected criteria.
4. Implement logic to highlight top performers with subtle green and bottom performers with subtle red highlights in the relevant tables.
5. Add CSS styles for subtle green and red highlights on performer names.
6. Implement toggle functionality to show/hide filter panel when clicking the filter icon.
7. Ensure the data refreshes dynamically every 3 seconds with active filters applied.
8. Test the filter UI and the color highlighting to confirm correct behavior and appearance.

## Follow-up:

- Verify smooth UI interactions for filter toggle.
- Confirm data filtering matches selected filters.
- Validate color highlights on top and bottom performers.
